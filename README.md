# Cryptsy Suite

An awesome Chrome extension to make Cryptsy.com more comfortable. The extension fully intigrates into the interface of cryptsy, there is no config page or something like this, just a few more options and gimmics on the interface itself.

## Features

* Hide/Toggle Sidebar boxes
* Show current price & market links on "Trade History"
* Filter history by "Buy" and "Sell"
* Click on the Time (top-left) to get your "Estimated Portfolio Value"
* Sort balance screen
* Use _watchers_ to make notes (probably actually a watcher later, now just notes)

## Donate

Feel free to say thanks or give me some motivation to extend this extension.
